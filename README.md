# Shopkart

 ***

The idea is to make an app for shopping close to Amazon<br>
We will have both the sections one for the buyers and one for the sellers.<br>

We'll be having the modules like this:<br>
1. We'll be having 4 activities<br>
      * One will be the splash screen<br>
      * Second is the dashboard for the buyers<br>
      * Third will dashboard for the sellers<br>
      * Forth is for the adding an item by the seller<br><br>
2. In the main activity we have to add the the following things-<br>
      * Search textbox<br>
      * some horizontal scrollable layouts for the products<br>
      * sidebar for the user details like past order and wishlist<br>
      <br><br>

3. We have to use dynamic widgets.<br><br>
4. We will use recycler view for the showing the layouts.<br><br>
5. We will use firebase/firestore for our stroing our user data and firebase cloud for the media storage.<br><br>


<br><br>

Main focus will be on how to implement it and not the UI.<br>
we will be using dynamic widgets for creating the widgets programatically.
<br>We will use kotlin and android studio.
